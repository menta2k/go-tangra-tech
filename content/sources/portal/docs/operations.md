# Operations — application gateway

## Bootstrap

1. Start the dependencies (`deploy/compose.yaml`: TimescaleDB with the
   `gateway` database and `gateway_app` role, Valkey, OpenFGA, Mailpit) and
   the auth module in gateway mode (`services/auth/deploy/gateway-mode.yaml`).
2. Seed the allow-list; a module cannot register before its SPIFFE identity is
   allowed for its prefixes and module names:

   ```bash
   gatewaysvc bootstrap -config deploy/dev.yaml \
     -allow "spiffe://example.org/svc/auth=/api/v1,/authorize,/.well-known,/console;auth" \
     -allow "spiffe://example.org/svc/hello=/api/hello;hello"
   ```

   Migrations run first; existing entries are skipped; every addition is audited
   (`allowlist_changed`).
3. Run `gatewaysvc -config deploy/dev.yaml`. The public edge listens on
   `edge.addr`; the registry on `server.grpc_addr` (Freya channel only).
4. Operators are members of the platform tenant holding one of
   `operators.roles` (default `operator`); the auth bootstrap invitation grants it.

## Mesh enrollment (`enroll`)

With `enroll.enabled` the gateway obtains its SVID from lcm at start. It
cannot enroll through its own edge, so it calls lcm's keyless enroll listener
directly (`enroll_url: https://lcm:9947/api/lcm/v1/enroll`), which presents
lcm's own SVID: a URI SAN `spiffe://<trust_domain>/svc/lcm`, no DNS name,
issued by the mesh root. Verify it with the mesh trust bundle:

```yaml
enroll:
  enabled: true
  enroll_url: https://lcm:9947/api/lcm/v1/enroll
  lcm_grpc: lcm:9945
  token_file: /tokens/gateway.token
  state_file: /state/svid.json
  ca_file: /certs/ca.pem          # mesh root bundle (lcm bootstrap output)
  # server_spiffe_id: spiffe://<trust_domain>/svc/lcm   (default)
```

`ca_file` unset means public verification (system roots + host name), which
lcm's SVID can never pass. `insecure: true` skips verification of this first
call (renewals are always verified); it is a development-only setting, warned
at start and refused when `env: production`. `insecure` and `ca_file` are
mutually exclusive.

## Console listener (`console`, feature 025)

BMC KVM consoles (ipam `/bmc/`) run the BMC vendor's JavaScript, so they are
served on an origin of their own — a second TLS port — and never on the
portal origin:

```yaml
edge:
  cert_file: /edge/tls.crt   # required: the console reuses this certificate
  key_file: /edge/tls.key
  # frame_sources: []        # other origins the shell may frame (optional)
console:
  enabled: true
  addr: 0.0.0.0:8444
  public_origin: https://portal.example.com:8444
  routes: { "/bmc/": ipam }  # default
  # cookies: [freya_kvm]     # default: the only cookie forwarded/relayed
  # session_max: 1h          # WebSocket lifetime (1m..24h)
  # max_concurrent: 64       # in-flight requests
```

- The listener serves only the configured prefixes and forwards them (HTTP
  and WebSocket) to the module over the mesh; everything else is 404. It
  authenticates nobody: ipam's single-use console token gates access.
- `public_origin` must differ from the portal's `public_origin` and must not
  be listed in `edge.allowed_origins`; the gateway refuses to start otherwise.
- The console origin is added to the shell's `frame-src`; console responses
  may be framed only by the portal (`frame-ancestors <public_origin>`).
- Set ipam's `kvm.console_origin` to the same origin.
- Publish the port and open it in the firewall for administrators. A
  distinct host name (`https://kvm.example.com`, with a certificate naming
  it) instead of a port isolates cookies completely (see the security model).

## Allow-list

- Managed at **Operations → Allow-list** or `POST /gateway/v1/ops/allowlist`
  (`{spiffe_id, prefixes[], names[]}`); revoke with
  `POST /gateway/v1/ops/allowlist/{id}/revoke`.
- One active entry per identity; prefixes are normalised; a registration is
  accepted only when every requested prefix is equal to or under a granted
  prefix and the module name is granted.
- Revoking an entry does not stop running instances; their next registration
  (restart or version bump) is refused with `identity_not_allowed`.

## Drain, undrain, revoke

| Action | Effect | Audit |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Drain | New requests to the module answer `temporarily_unavailable`; in-flight requests complete; renewals are refused so instances withdraw within the lease TTL (30 s) | `module_drained` |
| Undrain | Clears the mark; instances re-register within their backoff (≤ 30 s) | `module_recovered` (reason `undrained`) |
| Revoke | Durable: routes and remote disappear immediately, renewals and new registrations are refused until an operator clears the mark in the database (`module_marks.cleared_at`) | `module_revoked` with the reason (≥ 10 characters) |

Every action carries the operator's user id in the audit trail
(`GET /gateway/v1/ops/audit`, filters `module`, `event_type`, `from`, `to`,
`cursor`). Without `from` the page view covers the last 7 days (the legacy
`cursor`/`limit` view the last 24 hours); `to - from` may not exceed 90 days
— a wider range is refused with `400 validation_failed`, `detail.param:
"from"`. Query older periods in 90-day slices.

## Health

- Each instance is probed every 5 s over the channel (HTTP HEAD on its Freya
  HTTP server or a TLS handshake for gRPC-only backends); three consecutive
  failures mark it unhealthy (`module_unhealthy` when the last instance
  fails), a 10 s cool-down precedes the next probe, one success recovers
  (`module_recovered`). Forwarding failures count as observations too.
- Traffic in the operations view is per gateway instance over the last minute
  (requests, refusals, p95 latency).

## Valkey

The gateway's Valkey user needs key and channel access (`~* &*`): registry
changes are published on `gateway:registry`, and the auth service publishes
revocations the same way (an ACL without `&*` makes sign-out fail).

## Valkey loss

Registrations, leases and caches live in Valkey. If it becomes unreachable:

- the in-memory route table keeps serving the last known snapshot;
- new registrations and renewals fail with `registry_unavailable` (modules
  keep retrying); after the lease TTL nothing is withdrawn because sweeps see
  no keys — the gateway keeps routing to the last known instances;
- identity and decision caches miss, so every request costs one auth call;
  the gateway never fails open.

Restore Valkey and the instances refresh their leases on the next renewal.

## Rotation

- **Gateway identity**: the Freya identity provider renews the SVID; forwarders
  are rebuilt on rotation (client connections are re-dialled).
- **Module identity**: the registrant identity is fixed per module; a renamed
  service identity needs a new allow-list entry and a re-registration.
- **Auth signing keys**: verified through the auth module's key feed; no
  gateway restart is needed.
- **Edge certificate**: `edge.cert_file`/`edge.key_file` are re-read every
  minute and swapped without restart.

## Audit retention

`gateway_audit_events` is a TimescaleDB hypertable with a 400-day retention
policy; the application role can only insert and read it.
