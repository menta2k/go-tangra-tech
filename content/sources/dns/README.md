# go-tangra-dns

PowerDNS management plane for the
[go-tangra v4 platform](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra).

Tenants manage **zones and record sets** on one shared PowerDNS Authoritative
server, with global zone-name ownership (a name belongs to one tenant, and the
owner is never revealed to others). A PowerDNS **Recursor** forwards every managed
zone to the authoritative server. Zone templates, supermasters, BIND export and
NOTIFY, **IPAM sync** (IPAM addresses become A/AAAA and PTR records), the
**ACME DNS-01** challenge provider used by lcm, a curated metrics **dashboard**,
live updates and tenant backup come with it. Platform administrators edit the
**server configuration**: the service renders the PowerDNS include files and,
when enabled, restarts the two named PowerDNS containers through the Docker
Engine API. The PowerDNS API keys are secret **references** (warden in
production) that are resolved at use time and never logged.

Operations: [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).
Design history: `specs/015-dns-service`.

- Built on `github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra/v4` (mTLS transports, identity,
  service policy, audit, observability).
- Verifies platform tokens and checks permissions through the auth SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-auth/sdk/v4`).
- Registers with the gateway through the portal SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-portal/sdk/v4`), which fronts the browser API
  (`/api/dns`) and the federated UI remote.
- Enrolls for its SVID with lcm over the network
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-lcm/sdk/v4`), and serves lcm's DNS-01
  challenges (`dns.v1.Challenges`, only for the configured lcm SPIFFE ID).
- Reads IPAM addresses and subnets through the ipam SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-ipam/sdk/v4`) when it consumes
  `ipam.ip_address.*` events.
- Resolves `warden:` secret references through the warden SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-warden/sdk/v4`).

The repository holds one Go module, `github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-dns/v4`.
Other services call it through `pkg/dnsclient` and the `dns.v1` protos
(not proxied by the gateway).

## Build and test

You need Go 1.26, Node 22, Docker (for the integration suite and the image), and a
GitHub token with `read:packages` to install `@go-tangra/ui` from GitHub Packages.

```bash
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race ./...
buf lint
make test-integration                     # -tags integration: TimescaleDB, Valkey, PowerDNS 4.9 + Recursor 5.3 via testcontainers
make lint cover vuln redaction-scan

cd ui
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)   # ui/.npmrc only references this variable
npm ci && npm run lint && npm run test:unit && npm run build
```

The integration suite runs the pinned PowerDNS images on a shared Docker network
and checks real DNS answers from the authoritative server and through the
recursor, including the IPAM event path over Valkey. `DNS_IT_ADMIN_DSN` points it
at an existing TimescaleDB server instead of a container. It skips when Docker is
not available.

The unit coverage gate (`make cover`) excludes generated code, SQL bindings and
wiring, which the integration suite covers instead. The Playwright specs in
`ui/tests/e2e` need a running platform and operator credentials; they skip
otherwise.

## Run

The service runs in the go-tangra platform stack (`deploy/stack` in
[go-tangra](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra)), next to TimescaleDB, Valkey,
ipam and the `pdns-auth` / `pdns-recursor` containers. The stack mounts its
configuration at `/app/deploy/container.yaml` and the development key-encryption
key at `/app/deploy/kek.dev`. Its `dns-secrets-init` job generates the PowerDNS
API keys into the `dns-secrets` volume (`file:/secrets/pdns-*.key`) and writes the
API include snippets; the service renders its own include files into the shared
`pdns-auth-conf` / `pdns-recursor-conf` volumes. `deploy/kek.dev` in this
repository is a development key only; it is excluded from the image.

```bash
dnssvc bootstrap -config deploy/container.yaml    # apply migrations and exit
dnssvc -config deploy/container.yaml              # serve (applies migrations)
```

Listeners: gRPC `:9965` and HTTP `:9966` on the mesh (mTLS), admin `:9850`
(`/healthz`, `/readyz`). See `specs/015-dns-service/quickstart.md` for the
end-to-end walkthrough.

Container restart is off by default (`docker.enabled: false`). When enabled it
needs the Docker socket, which is root-equivalent on the host; the client only
restarts the two containers named in `docker.auth_container` and
`docker.recursor_container`, and only platform administrators can trigger it.
Production should put an API-filtering socket proxy in front of it
(`deploy/README.md`).

## Container image

The image is `ghcr.io/go-tangra/go-tangra-dns`, built by
`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. It carries `dnssvc` with the embedded UI remote.

```bash
docker buildx build --secret id=npm_token,env=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN \
  --build-arg APP_VERSION=4.0.0 -t go-tangra-dns:dev .
docker run --rm go-tangra-dns:dev version
```

The image runs `dnssvc -config deploy/container.yaml` as user `app`
(uid 10001). It contains no configuration and no key material: deployments mount
their own `deploy/container.yaml`, key-encryption key and PowerDNS API key
references. `deploy/pdns/` holds the reference PowerDNS base configs; the
service does not read them at run time (the platform stack carries its own copy).

## API permissions

`zones:read/manage`, `templates:manage`, `supermasters:manage`, `dashboard:read`,
`backup:manage`, and `config:manage` (platform administrators only). The gateway
enforces the per-route permission from the manifest; the module then checks the
tenant scope.

## Roles

The module registers its permissions with auth at start and every five
minutes, together with ready-made module roles that auth offers in every
tenant (locked; administrators assign them or clone them into custom roles):

| Role | Display name | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `administrator` | DNS administrator | every tenant permission: `zones:read/manage`, `templates:manage`, `supermasters:manage`, `dashboard:read`, `backup:manage` (not `config:manage`) |
| `viewer` | DNS viewer | `zones:read`, `dashboard:read` |

Built-in role grants (scoped to the DNS module by auth,
`pkg/dnsmanifest.Grants`): `owner` and `admin` hold the administrator set;
`operator`, `member` and `auditor` the viewer set. No tenant role holds
`config:manage`.

## Versioning

- Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z`. CI publishes the image as `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X`
  and `sha-<short>`. There is no `latest` tag.
- v4.0.0 rebuilds the service on the go-tangra v4 platform. The previous line
  stays on the `v3` branch and its `v3.x` tags.
