# go-tangra-paperless

Tenant document management service for the
[go-tangra v4 platform](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra).

It stores **documents** (metadata in TimescaleDB, bytes in S3-compatible object
storage such as RustFS or MinIO), organises them into a **category hierarchy**,
extracts their text asynchronously through **Apache Tika** (optionally converting
with **Gotenberg**), and makes them **full-text searchable**. Access is
Zanzibar-style (owner / editor / viewer / sharer, to users, roles or the tenant,
with expiry), inherited down the category tree. Object-store credentials are
sealed at rest (AES-256-GCM envelope) and never returned; extracted content
never reaches logs or the audit trail. Processing progress is published live on
the platform event bus, so the UI updates without polling.

Operations: [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).
Design history: `specs/009-paperless-service`.

## Place in the platform

```
go-tangra/go-tangra          platform module + @go-tangra/ui kit
        |
go-tangra-auth  <---->  go-tangra-portal (gateway)  <---->  go-tangra-lcm
                                  |
                        go-tangra-paperless  ---->  object storage (S3), Tika, Gotenberg
```

- Built on `github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra/v4` (mTLS transports, identity,
  service policy, audit, observability).
- Verifies platform tokens, resolves people and checks permissions through the
  auth SDK (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-auth/sdk/v4`).
- Registers with the gateway through the portal SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-portal/sdk/v4`), which fronts the browser API
  (`/api/paperless`) and the federated UI remote.
- Enrolls for its SVID with lcm over the network
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-lcm/sdk/v4`), as the platform stack does.

The repository holds two Go modules: the service,
`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-paperless/v4`, and the client SDK in `sdk/`,
`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-paperless/sdk/v4` (the `paperless.v1` protos and
`pkg/paperlessclient`). Other services call paperless over the mesh through the
SDK (not proxied by the gateway); the service requires the SDK through a
`replace ... => ./sdk`, and the SDK is released by hand with `sdk/vX.Y.Z` tags.

### Client SDK

```go
import "github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-paperless/sdk/v4/pkg/paperlessclient"

conn, _ := app.Client(ctx, "paperless")                 // SPIFFE mTLS
pc := paperlessclient.New(conn)
catID, _ := pc.EnsureCategory(ctx, tenantID, []string{"Assets", "AT-000123"})
doc, _ := pc.CreateDocument(ctx, tenantID, paperlessclient.CreateInput{
    CategoryID: catID, Name: "Warranty", FileName: "w.pdf", MimeType: "application/pdf", Content: b})
hits, _ := pc.Search(ctx, tenantID, "warranty", 20)
data, name, mime, _ := pc.DownloadDocument(ctx, tenantID, doc.ID)
_ = pc.DeleteDocument(ctx, tenantID, doc.ID, true)
```

Every method takes the tenant explicitly and returns plain Go types; gRPC
`NotFound` / `PermissionDenied` / `Unavailable` map to `ErrNotFound` /
`ErrForbidden` / `ErrUnavailable`. `EnsureCategory` is idempotent and safe for
concurrent callers. A calling service is identified by its SPIFFE id: it becomes
owner of the folders and documents it creates, finds them with `Search`, and may
create root folders and read the folder tree; it gets no collection access to
documents (tenant admins see everything). Each call carries 33 MiB message-size
bounds (`WithMaxMessageBytes` overrides), matching the server default. The caller
must also be allowed by `deploy/policy.yaml` (e.g. the `asset-documents` rule).

| `deploy` | service policy and operations notes |
| `ui/` | Vue 3 + FlyonUI federated remote on `@go-tangra/ui` |

## Build and test

You need Go 1.26, Node 22, Docker (for the integration suite and the image), and a
GitHub token with `read:packages` to install `@go-tangra/ui` from GitHub Packages.

```bash
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race ./...
(cd sdk && go vet ./... && go test -race ./... && buf lint)   # client SDK module
make test-integration                     # -tags integration, TimescaleDB via testcontainers (needs Docker)
make lint cover vuln

cd ui
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)   # ui/.npmrc only references this variable
npm ci && npm run lint && npm run test:unit && npm run build
```

The unit coverage gate requires at least 80 % overall and 100 % for the
authorization and sealing packages. Generated code, SQL bindings and wiring are
covered by the integration suite instead. The Playwright specs in `ui/tests/e2e`
need a running platform and operator credentials; they skip otherwise.

## Run

The service runs in the go-tangra platform stack (`deploy/stack` in
[go-tangra](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra)), next to TimescaleDB, Valkey,
RustFS, Tika and Gotenberg. The stack mounts its configuration at
`/app/deploy/container.yaml` and the development key-encryption key at
`/app/deploy/kek.dev`. `deploy/kek.dev` in this repository is a development key
only; it is excluded from the image.

```bash
paperlesssvc bootstrap -config deploy/container.yaml    # apply migrations and exit
paperlesssvc -config deploy/container.yaml              # serve (applies migrations)
```

See `specs/009-paperless-service/quickstart.md` for the end-to-end walkthrough.

## Container image

The image is `ghcr.io/go-tangra/go-tangra-paperless`, built by
`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. It carries `paperlesssvc` with the embedded UI remote.

```bash
docker buildx build --secret id=npm_token,env=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN \
  --build-arg APP_VERSION=4.0.0 -t go-tangra-paperless:dev .
docker run --rm go-tangra-paperless:dev version
```

The image runs `paperlesssvc -config deploy/container.yaml` as user `app`
(uid 10001). It contains no configuration and no key material: deployments mount
their own `deploy/container.yaml` and key-encryption key. Tika, Gotenberg and the
object store are separate services the configuration points at
(`extract.tika_url`, `extract.gotenberg_url`, `object_store.endpoint`); the
bucket is created on start when missing.

## API permissions

`documents:read/write/delete`, `categories:read/manage`, `search:read`,
`permissions:manage`, `backup:manage`, `stats:read`. The gateway enforces the
per-route permission from the manifest; the module then enforces the Zanzibar
grant on the document or category.

Sharing: holders of `permissions:manage` get a **Share access** button on a
document (document drawer) and on a category (selected-category card), which
opens the kit permission drawer (users, roles or everyone in the tenant, with
optional expiry). Grants on a category apply to everything inside it. Viewer and
sharer grants need share access to the resource; granting or revoking editor or
owner needs full (owner) control, so a sharer cannot promote anyone or remove an
owner. A revoke only reaches grants on the resource it names.

The module registers its permissions, its module roles and the built-in role
grants (`pkg/paperlessmanifest.Grants`, scoped to paperless by auth) with auth
at start and every five minutes (`pkg/paperlessmanifest.Registration`). Module
roles are provided in every tenant; administrators assign them or clone them
into custom roles:

| Role | Display name | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `administrator` | Paperless administrator | all paperless permissions |
| `editor` | Paperless editor | `documents:read`, `documents:write`, `categories:read`, `search:read` |
| `viewer` | Paperless viewer | `documents:read`, `categories:read`, `search:read` |

A module role grants the API permission only; access to an individual
document or category still needs its Zanzibar grant.

## Versioning

- Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z`. CI publishes the image as `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X`
  and `sha-<short>`. There is no `latest` tag.
- v4.0.0 rebuilds the service on the go-tangra v4 platform. The v3 line stays on
  the `v3` branch and its `v3.x` tags.
