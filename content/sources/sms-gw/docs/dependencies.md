# Dependency and porting map

The service module is github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-sms-gw/v4. Local baseline: framework v4.3.1, auth/portal/LCM SDK v4.1.0, Go 1.26.3 and toolchain 1.26.8, pgx v5.11.0, goose v3.28.0. Framework brings Kratos v3 transitively. No legacy common, Wire or tx7do bootstrap packages are used. go.mod currently requires only what the code imports (framework, auth SDK v4.1.0, pgx, goose, yaml, grpc, OpenTelemetry metric API, golang-jwt for Hermes tokens, golang.org/x/crypto bcrypt for Hermes passwords, google.golang.org/protobuf for the public request codec (runtime descriptors, no generated code), testcontainers for integration tests); the portal and LCM SDKs (v4.1.0) are added by the registration and enrollment tasks that use them. `tests/fixtures/legacy/source/` is a nested module so the legacy snapshot never joins the build.

| Source | Destination | Migration |
|---|---|---|
| cmd/server bootstrap + wire | cmd/smsgwsvc, internal/app | Freya lifecycle and pooled SDK clients |
| internal/data/ent/schema and repos | internal/store, internal/repo | SQL tables preserving IDs, tenant-safe references and explicit migrations |
| internal/auth | internal/auth | Retain Hermes claims/password behavior; persist revocations |
| internal/provider | internal/provider | Port Voicecom and provider metadata |
| internal/service SMS/template | internal/sms, internal/render | Separate domain pipeline from wire adapters |
| internal/server | internal/publicapi, internal/httpapi | Separate legacy public edge from V4 mesh management |
| internal/cert and registration | internal/identity, internal/app | Framework identity and V4 SDK registration |
| frontend | ui | V4 UI kit and federation; no copied build artifacts |
| webhook, acme, retention, metrics | corresponding internal packages | Preserve semantics and attach cancellable lifecycle |

UI uses @go-tangra/ui ^4.3.0, Vue ^3.5, Router ^5, Pinia ^4, CASL ability ^7/vue ^3, Zod ^4, Tailwind ^4 and FlyonUI ^2. Install requires GitHub Packages read permission through NODE_AUTH_TOKEN; tokens are never committed. Dependency resolution is checked independently of runtime Docker availability.
