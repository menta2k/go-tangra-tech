# Deployer

Distribute certificates to infrastructure targets and track deployment.

**Architecture role**: Infrastructure. [See the complete component map](architecture/index.html).

**Documented source**: `6aaba449a180` · nearest local service tag `v4.6.0` · v4 major. [Repository at this revision](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-deployer/tree/6aaba449a1803f912370061adb700847155cea80). Tags are source metadata, not a claim of image publication or cross-module compatibility.


## Permissions and authorization

This catalogue contains **9 permissions** declared by the [module manifest](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-deployer/blob/6aaba449a1803f912370061adb700847155cea80/pkg/deployermanifest/manifest.go) at the revision above. Custom-role references use `module:resource:action`; the manifest and API contract use the local `resource:action` form. The action names are distinct grants: do not assume `manage` automatically includes `read` or another action.

Module permissions gate actions within the authenticated tenant. The endpoint still enforces its resource and workflow checks; a UI ability describes presentation and does not replace server authorization.

[How to assign and verify permissions](architecture/security.html#assign-and-verify-permissions). Module roles and built-in grant mappings are defined in the linked manifest; review those mappings before assigning a broad role.

## Dependencies and integration

**Required**: TimescaleDB, Valkey, key-encryption key, Auth, Portal, mesh identity.

**Optional or feature-dependent**: LCM, Warden, deployment targets.

Configure only the target types and credentials you need. A successful LCM issuance does not prove a target delivery succeeded; check each target's result and its connectivity independently.

The list describes infrastructure/features, not every transitive library. Check the linked deployment reference for exact versions, enabled features and peer grants. [Framework dependencies](architecture/dependencies.html) cover the shared Go libraries.

## Runtime and operation

| Item | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Service binary | `deployersvc` |
| Public example configuration | `deploy/dev.yaml`; adapt endpoints and paths for your environment |
| Native source build | Go `1.26.3`, toolchain `go1.26.8`, Node 22 for UI |
| Image repository | `ghcr.io/go-tangra/go-tangra-deployer`; choose a published compatible version |
| Private admin default | `127.0.0.1:9690`; check actual configuration |
| Health and readiness | `/healthz` and `/readyz` on the configured admin listener |
| Web integration | Gateway registration, permission grants and federated UI |

Bootstrap initializes or validates the module's own stores; serving still needs a valid workload identity, reachable dependencies and policy. Logs, readiness, gateway registration and module-specific checks are described in the detailed references below.

## Configuration field index

The following names and types come from the public Go configuration structures. Group names identify nested types, not flat YAML paths. Required values, defaults, cross-field checks and enabled-feature behavior are explained by the module's source/operations references; never assume every listed setting is optional.

## API operation index

These operations are extracted from the module's OpenAPI contract. Read the source contract for request/response schemas, permission checks and exact route bases; internal mesh endpoints must not be treated as anonymous public APIs.

## Limits, diagnostics and recovery

Configure only the target types and credentials you need. A successful LCM issuance does not prove a target delivery succeeded; check each target's result and its connectivity independently.

Use the module's operations/deployment reference for retention, backup/restore, refusal behavior, interface examples and feature limitations. The installation guides cover common readiness, identity, registration and storage failures.

## Upstream overview: go-tangra-deployer

Certificate deployment service for the
[go-tangra v4 platform](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra).

It takes certificates issued by [go-tangra-lcm](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-lcm)
and installs them on infrastructure targets through pluggable providers (AWS ACM,
Cloudflare, F5 BIG-IP, FortiGate, a generic webhook, Linux hosts through the
go-tangra-inventory agent, and a dummy provider for tests). Deployments run as jobs on a distributed worker pool with leases,
retries and exponential backoff, and are triggered by hand or automatically
when lcm publishes `certificate.issued` / `certificate.renewed` events that
match a target's filters. Provider credentials are sealed with envelope
encryption (KEK -> DEK) and never returned in full; certificate bytes are never
stored: they are fetched from lcm over SPIFFE mTLS at deploy time and dropped
afterwards. Every operation is audited per tenant.

Operations: [`deploy/README.md`](sources/deployer/deploy/README.html).
Design history: `specs/008-deployer-service`.

## Place in the platform

```
go-tangra/go-tangra          platform module + @go-tangra/ui kit
        |
go-tangra-auth  <---->  go-tangra-portal (gateway)  <---->  go-tangra-lcm
                                  |                              |
                          go-tangra-deployer  ---- lcm.v1.Certificates/Download (mTLS)
```

- Built on `github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra/v4` (mTLS transports, identity,
  service policy, audit, observability).
- Verifies platform tokens and checks permissions through the auth SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-auth/sdk/v4`), and registers its
  permissions, module roles and built-in role grants with auth (see
  [Permissions and module roles](#permissions-and-module-roles)).
- Registers with the gateway through the portal SDK
  (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-portal/sdk/v4`), which fronts the browser API
  (`/api/deployer`) and the federated UI remote.
- Enrolls for its SVID with lcm and downloads certificate bundles from lcm
  through the lcm SDK (`github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-lcm/sdk/v4`). lcm's
  service policy must allow `spiffe://<td>/svc/deployer` to call
  `/lcm.v1.Certificates/Download`.
- Asks go-tangra-inventory to deliver certificates to its agents for the
  `inventory-agent` provider (`inventory.v1.CertificateDeliveryService` over
  mTLS, inventory SDK `github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-inventory/sdk/v4`).
  Inventory's policy must allow `spiffe://<td>/svc/deployer` to call those
  methods, its `cert_delivery.sources` must list `deployer`, and the
  deployer needs `discovery.static.inventory` and `inventory: { service:
  inventory }` in its configuration.

The repository holds one Go module, `github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra-deployer/v4`.
Other services call it through `pkg/deployerclient` and the `deployer.v1` protos.

## Permissions and module roles

The deployer registers with auth as module `deployer` (auth SDK
`authclient.Registration`, feature 019) at start, retrying every 5 s until
auth accepts, then every five minutes: its permissions, the module roles
(`pkg/deployermanifest.Roles`) and the built-in role grants
(`pkg/deployermanifest.Grants`). Module roles are locked in auth;
administrators assign them or clone them into custom roles:

| Role | Display name | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `administrator` | Deployer administrator | all nine deployer permissions |
| `operator` | Deployer operator | configurations:read, targets:read, jobs:read, jobs:manage, deploy:execute |
| `viewer` | Deployer viewer | configurations:read, targets:read, jobs:read, stats:read |

Skipped built-in grants (warn) and rejected roles (error) are logged as
`auth registration: ...`.

## Provider settings

The configuration drawer is generated from the provider descriptors served by
`GET /api/deployer/v1/providers` (feature 033): no provider field list lives in
the UI, and the same descriptors drive save-time validation on the server
(HTTP 422 naming `config.<key>` / `credentials.<key>`). Secrets are write-only:
never returned, blank on edit keeps the stored value. A required field that a
target may override can be left empty on a shared configuration; every
deployment target attaching it must then supply it in its override. The API response is
authoritative; this table is a summary of the shipped providers.

### Inventory agent provider

`inventory-agent` installs a certificate on Linux hosts that run the
go-tangra-inventory agent (4.7.0 or later, `cert.v1` capability). It
delivers **by reference**: the deployer never fetches the private key for
this provider; it sends the certificate id, a name and the host selection
(`host_ids` and/or `host_tags`) to inventory, which pushes an item id to each
agent. The agent pulls the bundle (and, with `key_policy: require`, the key)
over its own authenticated connection and installs it under
`<agent certificate directory>/live/<cert_name>/` in certbot layout. Leave
`cert_name` empty to derive it from the common name (`*.example.com` →
`wildcard.example.com`). What happens on the host after the files are
written (a reload hook, owner, modes) is configured only in the agent's
local `agent.yaml`, never by the deployer.

The job waits up to `wait_seconds` for the hosts to report. Offline hosts
stay queued in inventory and get the certificate when they reconnect; they
never fail a job, not even with `require_all_success`. A failed job retried
by the deployer re-arms the failed hosts under the same delivery. Verify
compares the SHA-256 fingerprint each host reports with the deployed
certificate. There is no rollback. "Preview hosts" in the drawer lists the
hosts a selection matches and whether their agents can receive
certificates. A host claimed by more than one non-revoked agent is shown as
"Several agents claim this host" and receives nothing until the stale or
foreign agent is revoked in inventory.

### Appliance profiles (BIG-IP `ssl_profile`, FortiGate `default_ssl_profile`)

Both options are optional. Left empty, BIG-IP installs the certificate
objects only and touches no profile; FortiGate still binds the certificate
into its own profile (see below).

- **BIG-IP** behaves as the v3 provider (3.5.1), with two deliberate
  differences (chain binding and rollback, below). Every Deploy, Verify and
  Rollback first checks that the appliance answers `/mgmt/tm/sys/version`
  (401: "authentication failed: invalid username or password"). The
  certificate, key and chain (when present) are uploaded to
  `/mgmt/shared/file-transfer/uploads/` (one chunk, `Content-Range`) and
  installed as `/<partition>/<name>.crt`, `/<partition>/<name>.key` and
  `/<partition>/<name>_chain.crt`, where `<name>` is the common name with
  `*` → `star` and every other character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` → `_`
  (`cert-<first 8 characters of the certificate ID>` without a usable
  common name) and `<partition>` defaults to `Common`. An object that
  already exists (HTTP 409 or "already exists") is uploaded again and
  installed with `overwrite`. A failed chain upload is only a warning.
  `ssl_profile` names a client-SSL profile (a name in the partition or
  `/Partition/name`): when it does not exist it is **created** with
  `{name, cert, key, chain, ciphers: "DEFAULT"}` (every other setting from
  BIG-IP's `clientssl` parent); when it exists (HTTP 409) its `cert` and
  `key` are PATCHed — its ciphers, parent, SNI and every other setting are
  kept. Unlike v3, the installed chain is bound as the profile's `chain`
  (create and update); without a chain a new profile gets `chain: "none"`
  and an update leaves the profile's chain alone. Without `ssl_profile` no
  profile is created or touched. Verify checks that the certificate object
  exists. Rollback removes the certificate and key (failures reported) and
  the chain (ignored); objects already gone count as removed. Unlike v3,
  Rollback never deletes the `ssl_profile` profile.
- **FortiGate** behaves exactly as the v3 provider (3.5.1), selected by
  `replace_strategy`:
  - `ssl_profile` (default): the leaf certificate (never the chain) is
    imported under a dated name (`<base>_<yyyymmdd>`, `_01`…`_99` for a
    second certificate on the same day, ≤ 35 characters; `<base>` comes from
    the certificate subject), or the identical certificate already on the
    device is reused. If the certificate family is referenced anywhere other
    than the provider-owned profile `<base><profile_suffix>` and
    `default_ssl_profile` (VIP, SSL-VPN, admin GUI, another profile), the job
    stops with "MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED" (the certificate stays imported,
    nothing else changes). Otherwise the owned profile is created by cloning
    the first existing replace-mode profile that has a server certificate,
    or from FortiOS defaults (mode `replace`, only this certificate) when
    there is none, or its server-certificate list is updated (family entry
    replaced in place, other domains kept). The family entry of
    `default_ssl_profile` is replaced in place (appended when absent; no
    write when already current); a missing `default_ssl_profile` is created
    the same way as the owned profile, while one in another server
    certificate mode stops with "MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED". Nothing is ever
    deleted.
  - `rebind`: dated import as above, then every SSL/SSH profile, the SSL-VPN
    and admin GUI certificate and every VIP pointing at an older family
    member is repointed (`rebind_references`), and superseded family members
    are deleted (`prune_old`; certificates still in use are kept and
    reported). A failed rebind fails the job.
  - `delete`: the legacy delete-then-import under the bare name; it fails
    while the certificate is in use.

  Verify reports the newest family member on the device. Rollback deletes
  every family member that nothing references any more.

**Migrating from v3.** A v3 BIG-IP configuration carries over unchanged
(`partition`, `ssl_profile`); differences from v3: `ssl_profile` may also
be a full `/Partition/name` path, partition and profile names with a slash,
tilde, space or a leading dot are refused before anything is sent, and
appliance answers are scrubbed of the password and private key. A v3
FortiGate configuration carries over unchanged: every v3 option has the same key and
default (`rebind_references` and `prune_old` stored as v3 strings such as
`"yes"` are still read). Differences from v3: an existing device certificate
is reused only when it is identical (v3 compared the serial only), and
profile names with a slash, backslash, quote, control character or (for
`default_ssl_profile`) a leading dot are refused. The BIG-IP `ssl_profile`
and the FortiGate `default_ssl_profile`, `profile_suffix`, `import_scope`
and `vdom` may be overridden per deployment target; the FortiGate
`replace_strategy`, `rebind_references` and `prune_old` (which decide what
the provider deletes) may not.

### Destination and credential safety

- Fields that decide where credentials go (`url`, `verify_url`,
  `rollback_url`, the appliance `host`) and the TLS and header settings are
  never overridable by a deployment target; stored overrides are filtered
  again at job start.
- Changing a configuration's destination (a URL or the credential host),
  on save or in "Test connection" of a stored configuration, requires every
  stored secret to be re-entered (or cleared) in the same request.
- Credential-bearing HTTP clients never follow redirects; a redirect is a
  failed deployment.
- Custom webhook headers may not carry authentication (`Authorization`,
  `Cookie`, names containing token, secret, key, auth, password,
  credential, jwt, session, bearer or signature); use the sealed credential
  fields.

## Build and test

You need Go 1.26, Node 22, Docker (for the integration suites and the image),
and a GitHub token with `read:packages` to install `@go-tangra/ui` from GitHub
Packages.

```bash
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race ./...
buf lint
make test-integration                     # -tags integration, TimescaleDB + Valkey via testcontainers
make vuln                                 # govulncheck gate

cd ui
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)   # ui/.npmrc only references this variable
npm ci && npm run lint && npm run test:unit && npm run build
```

The integration suites (`internal/app`, `internal/repo/repodb`,
`internal/stream/valkeykv`) start their own TimescaleDB and Valkey containers
and skip when Docker is unavailable. The Playwright specs under `ui/tests/e2e`
need a running platform (`E2E_BASE`, default `https://localhost:8443`) and
operator credentials (`E2E_OPERATOR_EMAIL`, `E2E_OPERATOR_PASSWORD`,
optionally `E2E_TOTP_SECRET`); they skip without a password.

## Run locally

The deployer needs the gateway, auth and lcm next to it, so it runs from the
go-tangra platform stack (`deploy/stack` in
[go-tangra/go-tangra](https://github.com/go-tangra/go-tangra)). The stack mounts
its configuration at `/app/deploy/container.yaml` and the development
key-encryption key at `/app/deploy/kek.dev`. `deploy/kek.dev` in this
repository is the same development-only key; it is excluded from the image.

```bash
deployersvc -config deploy/container.yaml             # serve (applies migrations)
deployersvc bootstrap -config deploy/container.yaml   # apply migrations and exit
deployersvc version
```

See `specs/008-deployer-service/quickstart.md` for the end-to-end walkthrough.

## Container image

The image is `ghcr.io/go-tangra/go-tangra-deployer`, built by
`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. It carries `deployersvc` with the embedded UI remote.

```bash
docker buildx build --secret id=npm_token,env=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN \
  --build-arg APP_VERSION=4.0.0 -t go-tangra-deployer:dev .
docker run --rm go-tangra-deployer:dev version
```

The npm token is mounted only for `npm ci` and never lands in a layer. Key
material under `deploy/` is excluded by `.dockerignore`. Tags `vX.Y.Z` publish
`X.Y.Z`, `X.Y` and `X`; pushes to `main` publish `sha-<short>`. There is no
`latest` tag.

## Versions

v4 is the go-tangra v4 platform rebuild. The v3 line stays on the `v3` branch
and its `v3.x` tags.
